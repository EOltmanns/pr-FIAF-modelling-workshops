### Work/Variant Elements

**Introduction**

Properties which terminate in blocks of text (`notes`, `content description`, `histories`) have been removed, as while interesting data could be derived from them which conform to `agent` or `event` information, they are best not retained in their original state. In this iteration, `language` has been pushed to a property of `manifestation`. `year of reference` has also been removed as a direct property in lieu of supplying a blank `event` with an attached date.

**1.2.1 Work/Variant Description Type**

These are expressed as subclasses of the `work/variant` class, and are used to apply a *type* of `work/variant`, e.g. `https://www.filmovyprehled.cz/cs/film/396690/sedmikrasky` > `rdf:type` > `fiaf:Monographic`.

```ttl
<https://fiafcore.org/ontology/Analytic> a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Analytic"@en ;
    dc:source "FIAF Cataloguing Manual D.1"^^xsd:string ;
    rdfs:subClassOf fiaf:WorkVariant .

<https://fiafcore.org/ontology/Collection> a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Collection"@en ;
    dc:source "FIAF Cataloguing Manual D.1"^^xsd:string ;
    rdfs:subClassOf fiaf:WorkVariant .

<https://fiafcore.org/ontology/Monographic> a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Monographic"@en ;
    dc:source "FIAF Cataloguing Manual D.1"^^xsd:string ;
    rdfs:subClassOf fiaf:WorkVariant .

<https://fiafcore.org/ontology/Serial> a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Serial"@en ;
    dc:source "FIAF Cataloguing Manual D.1"^^xsd:string ;
    rdfs:subClassOf fiaf:WorkVariant .
```

**1.2.2 Variant Type**

If the `work/variant` is a `variant` (inferred by being the target of a `has variant` statement), then the flavour of `variant` can be attributed from the D.2 controlled vocabulary, e.g. `Picnic at Hanging Rock (Director's Cut)` > `fiaf:hasVariantType` > `fiaf:Augmented`

```ttl
<https://fiafcore.org/ontology/hasVariantType> a owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:label "Has Variant Type"@en ;
    dc:source "FIAF Cataloguing Manual 1.2.2"^^xsd:string ;
    rdfs:domain fiaf:WorkVariant ;
    rdfs:range fiaf:VariantType .
```

**1.3.1 Identifier**  
**1.3.1.1 Identifier Type**

Working with RDF/OWL involves slightly different modelling considerations than working with a traditional CMS. A regular implementation of `identifier` would involve two fields: 'Identifier type':'Wikidata' and 'Identifier code':'Q1421747', or more simply 'Wikidata ID':'Q1421747'.

In RDF, *type* is an inherent part of declaring the existence of an entity, so you would do something like `http://collections.cinematheque.qc.ca/recherche/oeuvres/fiche/2082` > `hasIdentifier` > `blank node to represent the Wikidata identifier for this work (of type "Wikidata Identifier")` > `hasIdentifierText` > `Q1421747`. A blank node is a placeholder to show that there is a concrete entity which we are talking about (in this case "the wikidata identifier which corresponds with this work"), but we would not give this entity itself its own identity (or url).

A shorter option would be to drop the blank node, so `http://collections.cinematheque.qc.ca/recherche/oeuvres/fiche/2082` > `hasWikidataIdentifier` > `Q1421747`, but I prefer the extended version as it allows non-destructive ontology editing in the future, easpecially if you wished to extend the model (e.g. "true as of time").

Below is the connection between `work/variant` and `identifier` classes.

```ttl
<https://fiafcore.org/ontology/hasIdentifier> a owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:label "Has Identifier"@en ;
    dc:source "FIAF Cataloguing Manual 1.3.1"^^xsd:string ;
    rdfs:domain fiaf:WorkVariant ;
    rdfs:range fiaf:Identifier .
```

**1.3.2 Title**    
**1.3.2.1 Title Type**

Similar to `identifier`, *title type* would be expressed first on a blank node (with the possibility of further specific properties) followed by title-as-text, e.g. `https://www.filmovyprehled.cz/cs/film/396690/sedmikrasky` > `hasTitle` > `blank node for this title of this work (of type "Title Proper")` > `hasTitleText` > `Sedmikr√°sky`. Here we are just expressing the connection between the `work/variant` and `title` component of the statement. 

```ttl
<https://fiafcore.org/ontology/hasTitle> a owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:label "Has Title"@en ;
    dc:source "FIAF Cataloguing Manual 1.3.2"^^xsd:string ;
    rdfs:domain fiaf:WorkVariant ;
    rdfs:range fiaf:Title .
```

**1.4.1 Agent**   
**1.4.1.1 Agent Activity**

In a deviation from the manual, which seems to allow direct `work/variant` to `agent` relationships, here we require an intermediate `activity` entity, even if the nature of that `activity` is unknown.

This `activity` blank node could also link information explicit to that contribution to that `work` (e.g. salary, screentime, character name, how credited).

```ttl
<https://fiafcore.org/ontology/hasActivity> a owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:label "Has Activity"@en ;
    dc:source "FIAF Cataloguing Manual 1.4.1.1"^^xsd:string ;
    rdfs:domain fiaf:WorkVariant ;
    rdfs:range fiaf:Activity .
```

**1.3.3 Country of Reference**

Maybe one day `country` could be inferred based on location data attributed to `events` or `agents` (which would also allow for a plurality of interpretations of how to attribute film nationality to coexist), but it is historically a filmographic staple and extremely useful for disambiguation.

```ttl
<https://fiafcore.org/ontology/hasCountry> a owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:label "Has Country"@en ;
    dc:source "FIAF Cataloguing Manual 1.3.3"^^xsd:string ;
    rdfs:domain fiaf:WorkVariant ;
    rdfs:range fiaf:Country .
```

**1.4.3 Subject/Genre/Form Terms**

Form is a straightforward applucation from controlled vocabulary, e.g. `https://www.filmovyprehled.cz/cs/film/396690/sedmikrasky` > `hasForm` > `Feature`

```ttl
<https://fiafcore.org/ontology/hasForm> a owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:label "Has Form"@en ;
    dc:source "FIAF Cataloguing Manual 1.4.3"^^xsd:string ;
    rdfs:domain fiaf:WorkVariant ;
    rdfs:range fiaf:Form .
```
Same for `genre`, e.g. `https://www.filmovyprehled.cz/cs/film/396690/sedmikrasky` > `hasGenre` > `Allegory`

```ttl
<https://fiafcore.org/ontology/hasGenre> a owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:label "Has Genre"@en ;
    dc:source "FIAF Cataloguing Manual 1.4.3"^^xsd:string ;
    rdfs:domain fiaf:WorkVariant ;
    rdfs:range fiaf:Genre .
```

`Subject` is more complex, following the pattern of Form/Genre (treated as equivalent in the cataloguing manual) we would expect `work/variant` > `hasSubject` > `some subject`. But is the subject an entity or text? Entity would be preferable to manage polysemy, but what resource contains entities for all possible subjects (e.g. Catalogue examples: "Street-railroads", "Horse-drawn vehicles", "Automobiles"). Maybe here we could freely link out to external concepts, e.g. `https://www.filmovyprehled.cz/cs/film/396690/sedmikrasky` > `hasSubject` > `https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q870`.

```ttl
<https://fiafcore.org/ontology/hasSubject> a owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:label "Has Subject"@en ;
    dc:source "FIAF Cataloguing Manual 1.4.3"^^xsd:string ;
    rdfs:domain fiaf:WorkVariant ;
    rdfs:range fiaf:Subject .
```

**1.4.2 Events**

The modelling for `events` will be quite involved, here we are just declaring that a `work/variant` has an `event`.

```ttl
<https://fiafcore.org/ontology/hasEvent> a owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:label "Has Event"@en ;
    dc:source "FIAF Cataloguing Manual 1.4.2"^^xsd:string ;
    rdfs:domain fiaf:WorkVariant ;
    rdfs:range fiaf:Event .
```

**Other Properties**

`hasManifestation` and `hasWorkVariant` link the `work/variant` to child entities.
