# Modelling Workshops

Owing to a lot of recent conversation around formally modelling EN 15907, especially in relation to the FIAF Cataloguing Manual, we intend on holding a series of workshops to explicitly discuss these concepts in detail. These will take place weekly, starting Thursday 12th of January at 5pm CET and will be short meetings of no longer than an hour each. Our intention is to work sequentially though the classes expressed in EN15907 and discuss:

1. How is this entity defined in EN 15907?
2. How is this entity defined in the FIAF Cataloguing Manual?
3. Are there extant vocabularies for this class?
4. What attributes/relationships are specified for this class, and how should these be implemented?
