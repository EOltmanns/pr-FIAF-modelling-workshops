# Modelling Workshops

Owing to a lot of recent conversation around formal modelling of the FIAF Cataloguing Manual and EN15907, we intend on holding a series of workshops to explicitly discuss these concepts in detail. The goal of these workshops should be to provide both a formal implementation of the Cataloguing Manual (as RDF/OWL), as well as a shared model which could be used for the interoperability of film data between organisations.

These will take place weekly, starting Thursday 12th of January at 5pm CET and will be short meetings of no longer than an hour each.
