# Modelling Workshops
Owing to recent conversation around formal modelling of the FIAF Cataloguing   Manual and EN15907, we intend on holding a series of workshops to explicitly   discuss these concepts. The goal of these workshops will be to provide both a   formal implementation of the Cataloguing Manual (as RDF/OWL), as well as a shared   model which could be used for the interoperability of film data between organisations.

These will take place weekly, starting Thursday 12th of January at 5pm CET and   will be short meetings of no longer than an hour each.
